HIC Core-0 Service Interface Exception

Version 1.0

The HIC Core-0 kernel (the “Core-0”) is licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 2 only (GPL-2.0-only), as published by the Free Software Foundation.

In accordance with section 7 of GPLv2, the copyright holders of Core-0 grant you the
following additional permission, which supplements the terms of GPL-2.0-only:

1. Definitions

   For purposes of this exception:

   1.1 “Core-0” means the original and modified versions of the HIC kernel core,
       which implements the fundamental isolation, capability, and resource management
       mechanisms, and is intended to run at the highest hardware privilege level.

   1.2 “Privileged-1 Service Module” (or “Service”) means a software component that:
       (a) runs in a separate isolation domain (sandbox) at the same hardware
           privilege level as Core-0;
       (b) communicates with Core-0 exclusively through documented standard interfaces
           provided by Core-0, including but not limited to capability invocation,
           inter-process communication (IPC), system calls, or any other interface
           explicitly documented as a standard service interface in the official
           HIC documentation;
       (c) is not a modification of Core-0, and is not intended to be combined with
           Core-0 in a way that would create a single combined work (as defined by
           copyright law) other than through normal use of the aforementioned
           interfaces.

   1.3 “Standard Interfaces” means the interfaces documented in the official HIC
       documentation as being available for communication between Core-0 and
       Privileged-1 services. These interfaces are designed to be stable and are the
       ordinary means for services to interact with Core-0.

   1.4 “Larger Work” means a work that combines Core-0 with one or more Privileged-1
       Service Modules.

2. License Grant

   The copyright holders of Core-0 hereby grant you an additional permission under
   the terms of GPL-2.0-only to:

   2.1 Create a Larger Work by combining or linking Core-0 with one or more
       Privileged-1 Service Modules.

   2.2 Distribute the Larger Work under terms of your choice, provided that you
       comply with the requirements set forth in Section 3 below.

3. Conditions for Distribution of Larger Works

   If you distribute a Larger Work (whether in source or binary form), you must:

   3.1 Ensure that Core-0 itself remains licensed under GPL-2.0-only, and that any
       modifications you make to Core-0 are also subject to GPL-2.0-only. If you
       distribute Core-0 separately (not as part of a Larger Work), it must be under
       the terms of GPL-2.0-only with this exception preserved.

   3.2 Include a conspicuous notice in the Larger Work stating that Core-0 is
       licensed under GPL-2.0-only with this exception, and that Privileged-1 Service
       Modules may be covered by different licenses. A reference to this exception
       text or to the HIC project's license information is sufficient to satisfy
       this requirement.

   3.3 Make available, in a manner consistent with GPL-2.0-only, the complete
       corresponding source code for Core-0 (including any modifications you made to
       it) to any recipient who requests it, for a period of at least three years
       from the date of distribution.

4. Scope of Exception

   4.1 This exception applies only to the combination of Core-0 with Privileged-1
       Service Modules that use the Standard Interfaces as defined in Section 1.3.
       It does not extend to combinations where Core-0 is modified, adapted, or
       incorporated into a work in a manner that goes beyond normal use of the
       Standard Interfaces (for example, if Core-0's internal source code is copied,
       modified, and linked directly with a Service Module without using the
       Standard Interfaces).

   4.2 A Privileged-1 Service Module is not considered a derivative work of Core-0
       solely because it communicates via the Standard Interfaces or because it is
       distributed together with Core-0 as part of a Larger Work. Consequently, you
       may license Service Modules under any terms you wish, including proprietary
       licenses, provided that those terms do not restrict the rights granted by
       GPL-2.0-only for Core-0 itself.

   4.3 This exception does not impose any additional license terms on Privileged-1
       Service Modules. The terms under which you license Service Modules are your
       own choice, as long as they do not conflict with the requirements of this
       exception.

5. Modifications to Core-0

   5.1 If you modify Core-0, your modified version must still be licensed under
       GPL-2.0-only, and this exception must be retained in its entirety. You may,
       however, add your own additional permissions to your modified version, as
       permitted by GPLv2 section 7, provided that they do not conflict with this
       exception.

   5.2 Any modifications you make to Core-0 must be clearly documented, and you must
       include a notice in the modified files stating that you changed the files and
       the date of any change.

6. No Trademark License

   This exception does not grant any rights to use the names, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos of the HIC project, except as required for reasonable and
   customary use in describing the origin of the work and reproducing the content
   of any copyright notice.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability

   THE CORE-0 IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION
   OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
   CORE-0 OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE CORE-0.

8. Acceptance

   By using, modifying, or distributing Core-0, you indicate your acceptance of this
   exception and the terms of GPL-2.0-only. If you do not agree to these terms, you
   may not use, modify, or distribute Core-0.
